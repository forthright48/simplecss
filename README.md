# SimpleCSS

A simple minimalistic CSS framework that uses flexbox grid.

Please, do not expect anything from the framework, cause I am not sure what I am doing.

## Normalize.css

First of all, include normalize.css file from src in the project to normalize browser behavior. Refer to [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for more details.
